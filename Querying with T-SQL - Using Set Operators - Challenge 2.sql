Challenge 2: Filter Customer Addresses
You have created a master list of all customer addresses, but now you have been asked to create filtered lists that 
show which customers have only a main office address, and which customers have both a main office and a shipping address. 
Tip: Review the documentation for the EXCEPT and INTERSECT operators in the Transact-SQL Reference.

1. Retrieve customers with only a main office address. Write a query that returns the company name of each 
company that appears in a table of customers with a �Main Office� address, but not in a table of customers with a �Shipping� address.
